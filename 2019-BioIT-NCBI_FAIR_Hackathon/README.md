## Objectives of this hackathon project

We outlined four top objectives with tangible deliverables that would accommodate people of different backgrounds, skillsets and interests, and formed working groups to tackle them. Here's an overview of the four main buckets of work we identified:

![Project design](../images/project-design.png)

1. [Data in demand](../docs/Data-in-Demand.md): Search the research space to determine specifications of datasets (exomes? wgs? what coverage?) that would be most useful to generate as freely available resources so that people don't have to generate them from scratch every time. Most suitable for people with high scientific chops but low computational chops.

2. [Diversifying Options](../docs/Diversifying-Options.md): Explore extending synthetic data sets to include additional variant types. Our current prototype can only spike-in SNPs, but the tools we leverage can do other variant types. Most suitable for people with analytical and/or pipeline development experience.

3. [Method optimization](../docs/Method-Optimization.md): Make the workflows faster and cheaper to run. Our original prototype workflows are not very efficient in terms of either cost or runtime; if we want to build this out at scale we need the synthetic data sets to be more convenient and less costly to generate. Most suitable for people with algorithm and/or pipeline development experience.

4. [Quality control](../docs/Quality-Control.md): Add quality control. Once we generate the synthetic data, we need to make sure it matches what we expect based on method parameters, that it is suitable for its intended purposes, and we need to verify that we can pull out the variants that we spiked in. Most suitable for people with analytical and/or pipeline development experience.

## Workspace in Terra

For the purposes of the hackathon, we performed all computational work on [Terra](https://terra.bio/), an open cloud-based platform for genomic analysis operated by the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute. 

This project was sponsored by a Google Education Grant (https://cloud.google.com/edu/). 
The shared workspace for the hackathon can be accessed publicly here:

## Hackathon project results

We summarized our results [here](./results.md) on Day 2, and later presented a more polished recap and summary in the FAIR data track of the BioIT conference. Those slides are here in [PPT](./BioIT19-FAIR-hackathon-syntheticdata-report.ppt) and [PDF](./BioIT19-FAIR-hackathon-syntheticdata-report.pdf), and on slideshare [here](https://www.slideshare.net/GeraldineVanderAuwer/bio-ithackathon/GeraldineVanderAuwer/bio-ithackathon).
