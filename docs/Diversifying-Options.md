## Goals

1. Extend the mutation spike-in workflow to make it possible to introduce other variant types than single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

## Proposed tasks
A WDL uses Bamsurgeon for spiking variants 
Currently the WDL only supports SNVs
Adding INDELs & SVs


### Read data generation

1. TBD

### More variant types

1. TBD
