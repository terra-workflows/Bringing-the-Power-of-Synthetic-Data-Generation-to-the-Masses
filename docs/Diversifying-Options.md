## Goals

Provide more user-configurable options for generating read data and spiking in mutations.

Extend the mutation spike-in workflow (a WDL using Bamsurgeon) to make it possible to introduce other variant types than single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

## Proposed tasks

### Generating read data

- Assess what other options of the NEAT Genreads tool that we'd like to expose through configurable parameters.

### Spiking in mutations

- [x] Add Indels to Bamsurgeon WDL
- [ ] Add CNVs and SVs to Bamsurgeon WDL
- Assess what other options of the BAMSurgeon tool that we'd like to expose through configurable parameters.
